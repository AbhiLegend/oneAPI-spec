  * Dates of releases and ability to make changes for individual elements
  * coupled versions vs elements versioning
    * concern about in sync vs time, don't want randomness in components
  * macro for testing which version of spec is supported by implementation
    AR: Robert, define following pattern for components

    AR: encourage implementations to refer to oneAPI version number
    not element number for master number, unless reason

    major.minor relates to IP, revision for everything else
    we should be able to change minor more quickly.
    revision can update mapping to element versions
    update rev on quarterly releases
